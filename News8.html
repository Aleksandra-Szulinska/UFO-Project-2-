        <p class="newsparagrath">Denisa Tanase, 36, was working on a flight from Luton to Syzmany in Poland when she spotted a stunning view out of the window. She grabbed her phone and took a video.</p> 
        <p>Even aliens have caught Barbie fever.

            A flight attendant believes she captured the moment a hot pink “UFO” nonchalantly buzzed past her plane as it soared above Europe.
            
            Four unusually shaped pink orbs blinked clearly against the dark nighttime sky, distinctly separate from the cityscape below, the video she shot shows.
            <br><br>
            <b>“I’ve been a flight attendant for a year and have never seen anything like this,” Wizz Air worker Denisa Tanase, 36, told SWNS.</b>
            <br><br>
            The UK native didn’t initially notice the odd sight when she filmed it on her flight from Luton, England, to Syzmany, Poland.
            
            She snapped what she thought was just a video of the stunning view out the window and put her phone away.
            
            “I couldn’t see anything with my bare eyes,” Tanase recalled.
            “But when I checked the video 20 minutes later, I spotted it and I spoke to the pilot to ask if they knew anything. Everyone was confused — they hadn’t seen anything while flying and there had been no turbulence.

            “It was a weird shape, like a circle flashing pink. At first, we thought maybe it was a reflection of our pink uniform, but on the video, you can see the motion — you can see it’s flying.”
            
            Despite filming something almost inexplicable, Tanase said, she didn’t feel scared.
            Instead, she felt excited and claims the video served as proof to her that extraterrestrial life exists.

            <br><br>
           <i> “I was just happy that I got something on film — I thought, ‘How is this possible?'” the mom of two said. “I’ve seen stuff before on the internet and thought, ‘Hmm, this could be Photoshop,’ but I had it on video myself.
            <br><br>
            “Now I definitely believe more than before,”</i>she continued.
            <br><br>
            <i>“My family and friends think it is definitely aliens — my husband said, ‘You’re my wife, I believe you.'”</i></p>
