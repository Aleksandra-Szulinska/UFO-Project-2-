José Jaime Maussan caused a stir in September when he unveiled what he claimed were the 1,000-year-old fossils of "non-human beings" found in Peru.The lower chamber of Mexico’s congress once again turned to spectacle on Tuesday, devoting hours of its time to a controversial figure who pressed the case for the fossiled remains of "non-human beings" he said were found in Peru.

    Less than three weeks after Category 5 Hurricane Otis devastated Acapulco, a port of nearly 1 million people, the Chamber of Deputies spent more than three hours listening to José Jaime Maussan and his group of Peruvian doctors.
    
    Maussan and some Mexican lawmakers became the subject of international ridicule in September when he presented two boxes with supposed mummies found in Peru. <p>

He along with others claimed they were "non-human beings that are not part of our terrestrial evolution".

   <b>In 2017, Maussan made similar claims in Peru, and a report by that country’s prosecutor’s office found the bodies were actually "recently manufactured dolls, which have been covered with a mixture of paper and synthetic glue to simulate the presence of skin".</b> <p>


  <br>  
The report added the figures were almost certainly human-made and that "they are not the remains of ancestral aliens that they have tried to present". 

The bodies were not publicly unveiled at the time, so it is unclear if they are the same as those presented to Mexico’s congress.

On Tuesday, Dr. Daniel Mendoza showed photographs and x-rays of what he said was a "non-human being". 

Maussan said it was a "new species" as it did not have lungs or ribs.

Lawmaker Sergio Gutiérrez Luna, from the governing party of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said <br><i>"all ideas and all proposals will always be welcome to debate them, hear them to agree with or not".'</i></p>
