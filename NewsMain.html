        <p>The US Senate subcommittee on Armed Services held an unclassified briefing with the Director of AARO, or All-domain Anomaly Research Office, and in it they revealed video of an unidentified flying object.</p>
        <br><br>
        Videos and photos have recently surfaced in Mystery Wire and Extraordinary Beliefs — websites that document sightings of unidentified flying objects — showing objects described as a "sphere," "acorn," "pyramid" and "metallic blimp."
        <br><br>
        <b>"I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel," Department of Defense spokeswoman Sue Gough told CBS News in an email. </b>
        <br><br>
        <i>"As we have said before, to maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, DOD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.]"</i>
        A spokesman for the task force says the sightings occur on a frequent basis in different areas of the country and different areas of the world. 

The intelligence community is expected to publicly brief Congress on some of these sightings this summer after the Senate Intelligence Committee asked for more information on UFOs. </p>
